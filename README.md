# Nodejs ES6 Express Template 

## Everything we used to make this project

### Technologies used

#### ECMAScript 7 (“ES7” / JavaScript)
ECMAScript™ is the standard behind JavaScript. It has had a number of very useful additions over the past several years, modernizing the syntax and providing new capabilities.

#### Babel
Not all browsers are able to run ES7. We use Babel to generate earlier versions of JavaScript from ES7, so that it will run on browsers that haven’t yet implemented the newer standard.

#### Node.js
Node enables us to use JavaScript outside of a browser and directly on our machines to perform the logic necessary to determine what messages to send to the end user and when.

#### Express.js
Express is a helpful framework built around Node.js for performing actions as a web server. e.g, Taking web page requests, responding and serving images to users.

#### Embedded JavaScript Templates (EJS)
EJS is a very simple templating language. This helps us create HTML for the pages we show in a programmatic way, and inject values into a web page. Here we use it to decide whether to show the Preferences view, the Product view or the Error page, and to point the WebView at the correct list for the viewer.

#### Socket.IO
Simplifies real-time interactions between users and the server.
